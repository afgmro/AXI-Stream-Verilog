# Notes for AXI4

B stands for buffered, because the response from the slave happens after all writes have completed.
## Improve bandwidth and latency of data transfers and transactions:
  Independent read and write channels
  Multiple outstanding addresses
  No strict timing relationship between address and data operations
  Support for unaligned data transfers 
  Out-of-order transaction completion: different ID values
  Burst transactions based on start address
